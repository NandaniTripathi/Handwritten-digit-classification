# Handwritten-digit-classification
Handwritten digit classification using the MNIST dataset is a classic "hello world" problem in machine learning. It's often one of the first projects for those learning about neural networks. The goal is to train a model that can take an image of a handwritten digit (from 0 to 9) and accurately predict what digit it is.

The MNIST dataset (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large collection of handwritten digits. It has a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each image is a 28x28 pixel grayscale image.
