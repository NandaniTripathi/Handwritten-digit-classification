# Handwritten-digit-classification
Handwritten digit classification using the MNIST dataset is a fundamental deep learning project. A neural network is trained on 60,000 images of handwritten digits to learn patterns. The network, typically with an input layer of 784 neurons, hidden layers, and a 10-neuron output layer, uses backpropagation to accurately predict the correct digit.
